# Release process

## Creating a new version (e.g. v1.1.0)

1. **Ensure everything is ready**
   - [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) has the target version with date and full entry; `[Unreleased]` is at the top.
   - [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) has a section "Upgrading to X.Y.Z" with what's new and upgrade steps.
   - Tests pass: `make test` and `make test-ts`.
   - Static analysis: `make phpstan` and `make cs-check`.

2. **Commit and push** any last changes to your default branch:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Prepare v1.1.0 release"
   git push origin HEAD
   ```

3. **Create and push the tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0"
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions** (if configured) may create the GitHub Release from the tag.

5. **Packagist** will pick up the new tag; users can then `composer require nowo-tech/uptime-monitor-bundle`.

## After releasing

- Keep `[Unreleased]` at the top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the next version.

After creating the release commit and tag, run `make check-no-cursor-coauthor` again **before** `git push` (REQ-GIT-001). The release commit itself is not covered by an earlier `release-check` run.
